From Curse

After completing the new tutorial missions, I found an "invisible" item in my bag that couldn't be delete and broke the bag display for both the standard blizzard bags and some addons. I could be moved to a bank where it appeared as a "?" item, but still couln't be deleted (and still broke BetterBags).

This is a mod written to delete that item, which may well work on other broken items for other people (or not, which is why it's experimental).

Blizzard have made it very hard for mods to delete bag/bank items, for good reason. If this mod doesn't work, or worse, deletes the wrong item(s), sorry, it wasn't intentional!
